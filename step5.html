  Patch Tool allows us to actually draw a selection area around what we want to 
get rid of and then click and drag 
  that area to a region we want to use to replace the original area. This may 
  sound a little confusing, so let's give it a try and see how it works.</span></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Right click the Healing Brush Tool and then click the Patch Tool...<br>

</ol><hr>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=" line-height: normal;    ">With the 
first option selected, which is called Replace (in the image above it is the 
second icon from the left), Photopea knows to replace whatever we select with 
the new area we move it to. I know, this is still a little confusing, and when 
you actually use the tool in the next directions you will understand what I'm 
talking about. I just wanted to point out here that there are three other 
options for how Photopea handles the objects in the selection area. We don't 
have the time now to get into exactly what each one does, just let me mention 
real quick that instead of removing objects like we are doing, that you can 
actually combine separate areas and make all kinds of cool stuff by using the 
other options. Feel free to take a minute and use the other setting just to see 
what they do. Be sure you undo any changes before moving on.</p><hr>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=" line-height: normal;    ">The 
function of the Patch Tool is actually pretty hard to explain in a written 
tutorial, but once you use the tool it is obvious how it functions. Once 
again, keep in mind that Photopea is not simply replacing the area in the 
selection with whatever you point at with the mouse. Instead, it is blending the 
two areas together, so be careful what area you use as your new content because 
if the area you are replacing and the new area are vastly different in color, 
tone, tint, etc, you will get all kinds of strange results.</p>
<ol start="8">
	<li>
	Go 
	around the image and remove any people or objects that the Patch Tool will 
	be quick and effective on<br>
	HINT: This tool is actually really helpful with this image</li>
</ol>
Let's save 
our work up to this point.</font>
<ol start="9">
<li>
Click File and then click Save as PSD...</li>
<li>
Save the image in the Remove 
    Objects folder as remove.psd</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next Step will use a similar process to the Path Tool, but in reverse. 
Head to Step 6 to see what I mean.</p>
