As mentioned in the previous Step, the Content Aware Fill is not actually a tool 
on the toolbar, but instead works by using the Fill command. Normally, the Fill 
command simply fills a selection with color, but when using Content Aware Fill, Photopea looks at the pixels surrounding a selection and fills that selection area with something that matches 
what is around it. This time, Photopea does not try to blend the pixels together, 
  so this method works great on areas with lines and edges. Working with the 
  Content Aware Fill works slightly different from the other tools that we have 
  used so far, so let's get some practice with it.</span></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Click the Lasso Tool...<br>

	<li>
	<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Staying in the same region of the image 
	that we have been working with, click and drag to make a selection area 
  of the people indicated below...<br></span>
	<img border=0 width=872 height=302
src="7/02.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_56"><br>
	Remember that if we want to select two non-connected areas that you first 
	draw a circle around one area, like the person on the left, and then press 
	and hold the Shift key as you draw a circle around the person on the right</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=" line-height: normal;    ">Be 
careful here that you draw your selection area around only the items that you 
want to remove. If you try to draw a large circle around both people like 
this...</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=" line-height: normal;    ">This is 
obviously not an ideal result because we will have to take the time to 
replace the missing line segment. It would be great if we could remove the 
people and didn't have to worry about fixing a broken line. Luckily for us, if 
we make a good enough selection, like the one in direction 2 above, Photopea 
will help us out with the line. Keep going to see how this works.</p>

to look at the surrounding pixels and recognize that the

applies the Content Aware Fill.&nbsp; Simply redoing the Content Aware Fill 
usually fixes this issue.</p>

the directions below if Photopea did not remove one or both of your people.</p>

If 
	it doesn't work this time, try reapplying the Content Aware Fill 
	several times to see if it works (yes, it may work one time and not the next 
- Photopea reapplies the transformation algorithm each time you apply the fill, 
so it is possible to get different results through multiple applications with 
the same selection)</li>
	<li>
If 
	after reapplying the Content Aware Fill multiple times you still do not have 
	a complete line, you will need to deselect (Ctrl+D) and redraw your

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=" line-height: normal;    ">Keep in 
mind when using the Content Aware Fill that Photopea is not blending anything 
together this time. It is simply looking at the area surrounding your selection 
and trying to use that area to replace your selection. Also be aware that it is 
not necessary for the area around the selection to be simple like with the image 
we are using (we just have gray concrete and a white line). For example, we can use Content 
Aware Fill on images like the one below...</p>

as there are similar elements around what we are removing (in the picture above, 
notice that there are trees, sky, and water on both sides of the balloon), Photopea can handle filling in the spot. 
If you look closely, you can see how Photopea replaced the balloon...</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=" line-height: normal;    ">The 
black outline is where the balloon was, and the red arrows are showing that to 
remove the balloon, Photopea simply made a copy of the tree on the left and 
placed it in the center over the balloon. This method works great if things are 
generally the same around the selection, but be careful. If there 
is a collection of different objects around your selection you will get 
unexpected results. Consider the image below...</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=" line-height: normal;    ">Photopea 
was able to recognize that there were windows on either side of the cat and did a pretty 
good job of removing him. Yeah, the brick lines are not perfect, but it is 
much easier to use Content Aware Fill to remove the cat and then correct those 
lines using one of the tools we've discussed then it is to try and remove the cat through other means.</p>
<hr>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=" line-height: normal;    ">While 
Content Aware Fill is an incredibly useful technique, as we have seen it does have 
some issues. Here are a few things to keep in mind while using Content Aware Fill:</p>
<ol type="A">
	<li>
As we showed above with the junkyard image, Photopea has a problem with images 
	that have lots of different objects and details surrounding your selection</li>
	<li>
The 
	larger the object being removed the lower the quality of the final result</li>
	<li>

	Patterns and lines (such as the bricks in the cat photo) may be distorted 
	and not line up correctly (this is usually easy to fix)</li>
	<li>
The 
	selection that you create with the Lasso Tool is important - changing the 
	selection even slightly can result in a vastly different outcome</li>
	<li>
Even 
	if the end results are not perfect, using Content Aware Fill can be a quick 
	and easy first step that allows you to easily clean up the image using any of 
	the other tools we have covered (fixing the brick lines in the cat image, for 
	example, is super easy, barely an inconvenience)</li>
	<li>
It is 
	very common for there to be additional clean-up after using Content Aware 
	Fill, especially if the background is 'busy', so don't be surprised</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=" line-height: normal;    ">Let's take 
a minute now to practice using Content Aware Fill.</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li>
	Go 
	around the image and remove any people or objects that Content Aware 
	Fill will 
	be quick and effective on<br>
	HINT: Remember that Content Aware Fill works best when the surrounding area 
	is similar on both sides</li>
</ol>
</font>
<Font face="Times New Roman">
<Font face="Times New Roman,serif">
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=" line-height: normal;    ">Let's save 
our work up to this point.</p></font>
<ol start="7">
<li>
Click File and then click Save as PSD...</li>
<li>
Save the image in the Remove 
    Objects folder as remove.psd</li>
</ol>
<p>For our final tool, we will be using the Clone Tool, which is kind of a tool 
of last resort. Head over to Step 8 to see how it works.</p>
