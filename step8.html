<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The 
  Clone Tool works similar to the Healing Brush Tool in that we begin by 
  defining an area that we wish to clone. We then draw over the unwanted area to 
  replace it with the source area. Yeah, I know, that explanation is not very 
clear. The truth is that it is kinda hard to explain exactly how this tool 
works, so let's just use it and you will quickly understand what is going on.</span></p>

What is going on here is really pretty simple. When you Alt+click a spot while 
using the Clone Tool to tell Photopea to use that spot as source material. When 
you begin to color over what you want to remove, you will notice that Photopea 
places a small + sign on the spot that is using as source material to cover the 
object you wish to get rid of. While removing the person in red, we are actually 
making a copy of the building at the location we clicked in direction 6 above.
</font><Font face="Times New Roman">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In 
  this case, the person is easy to remove because using the soft mechanical brush means the 
  edges of where we draw blends in with the existing texture. And since there is 
a lot going on structurally at that spot, what we drew tends to blend in with 
the surrounding area and we have a very difficult time figuring out where the 
person in red was after we zoom out.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:

<Font face="Times New Roman">
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The 
Clone Tool is also very capable when it comes to removing objects next to a line 
(or a building, or a tree, or anything else we don't want to destroy). We simply 
need to change to a solid brush.</span></p>
<ol start="9">
	<li>
	<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">On 
  the Clone Tool options bar, go into the Brush Preset picker and set the 
  brush to Hard Round...<br></span>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=" line-height: normal;    ">The 
Clone Tool is only really limited by your ability to find an area within the 
image that serves as a good source of material to cover up the object you are 
trying to get rid of. Realistically, we could have used the Clone Tool to remove 
every person and object in the image we don't want (and there are some designers 
and photographers who use the Clone Tool exclusively, but doing so would have 
been very time consuming. The other tools and techniques that we have covered 
generally make our lives easier by being quicker and easier than the Clone Tool. 
Still, when one of the other tools does a less than stellar job, the Clone Tool 
is always available to clean things up. The ability to control the brush shape 
and size means we can get extremely precise with our work. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=" line-height: normal;    ">As a quick 
reminder, unlike most of the other tools we have used in this lesson, the Clone 
Tool does not blend colors together. Instead, it is very simply replacing one 
area with another. Know that while this keep us from having to worry about two 
colors blending together, it means that there may be times when we have to 
manually blend color together. If the the areas we are using are vastly different in color, 
tone, tint, etc, you will get all kinds of strange results.</p>

our work up to this point.</p>

Click File and then click Save as PSD... and save the image in the Remove 
    Objects folder as remove.psd</li>

<p>In the final Step of this lesson, we will take a look wrapping up our 
Colosseum image and talk about using what we have learned to edit other image.</p>
